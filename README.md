# Course 8 - Practical Machine Learning Course Project README

### Predictive Model Creation - Version 1.0

### Coursera class participant

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which a group of 6 participants performed barbell lifts correctly or 
incorrectly in 5 different ways.  Using measurements from accelerometrs on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell as well as 
a "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, 
what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. 
You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

The contents within this github are:

1. The raw data used
2. The knitr markup created to 
3. The resulting html result.   

The details for these components can be found in the contents section below.
